# My Three.js Project

This is a minimal TypeScript project using Three.js and Vite for a smooth development experience. The project demonstrates a simple rotating cube rendered using the Three.js library.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher is recommended)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-threejs-project.git
cd my-threejs-project

2. Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

3. Run the development server:

`npm run dev`

This will open the project in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/. The server will automatically reload the browser when you make changes to your code.
